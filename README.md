[Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) by Martin Fowler

## Why I Found It Interesting

Refactoring is the process of improving the internal structure of existing code without changing its external behavior.  
I found this article (and the accompanying book summary) fascinating because it emphasizes that **good code evolves**. Instead of waiting for a perfect design before writing, developers can iteratively improve their work, making the codebase more readable, maintainable, and flexible over time.

I also appreciated how the piece highlights the importance of automated tests. They serve as a safety net, ensuring that as we clean up and reorganize the code, functionality remains intact. This mindset feels empowering — it shows that software engineering is not about writing flawless code the first time, but about building systems that can adapt and grow.

I think the insight is pretty important. Iteration during the development is so crucial and decision should be made during this process.
